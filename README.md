# Voice Control Assistant with RIVA

Project uses Nvidia RIVA with pretrained models for a full pipeline from ASR, NLP, and TTS that can query from SQLite with voice.

## Purpose for this project

I wanted to build an voice assistant to see if it could retrieve information from a database easily. I thought there was not many good solutions that provided a lot of the tooling that could be done out-of-the-box without doing a lot of configuration and experimentation.
